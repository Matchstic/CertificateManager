# CertificateManager
Electron app to manage iOS codesigning certificates

This is a *tiny* Electron app to allow users to manage and revoke iOS codesigning certificates. 

It is especially useful if Cydia Impactor throws an `ios/submitDevelopmentCSR` error, which cannot be fixed via Cydia Impactor's `Revoke Certificates` option.
